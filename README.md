# Analyzing Suicide Rates

## Problem Statement
Mental health in the United States has been on a sharp decline, as reported by the Mental Health America Association. This crisis is intertwined with factors such as poverty, substance use, and increasing suicide rates. Addressing this issue requires actionable insights, not just awareness.
This program provides an interactive data analysis platform that enables users to explore and analyze suicide-related data from recent years. By visualizing and examining patterns in the data, users—whether they are concerned individuals, policymakers, or mental health professionals—can identify concerning trends and correlations that require attention.
For instance, one notable finding this program highlights is the rising suicide rates among younger populations over the past 68 years and the increased vulnerability of older individuals to suicide. Insights like these can inform targeted interventions and resources to better address mental health challenges.
With this program, the goal is to empower users to make data-driven decisions and advocate for meaningful solutions in the fight against the mental health crisis.
